Bellow is the example of Self-documenting code

In computer programming, self-documenting (or self-describing) source code
and user interfaces follow naming conventions and structured programming conventions
that enable use of the system without prior specific knowledge.
In web development, self-documenting refers to a website that exposes the entire process of its creation through public documentation,
and whose public documentation is part of the development process.
